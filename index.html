            Flossy Friends Academy is a fun, hands-on program created by Dr.
            Ayanna and the team at Friendship Pediatric Dentistry designed to
            introduce 5th–8th grade girls to the exciting world of dentistry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through engaging activities, real-life demonstrations, and inspiring
            conversations, participants will explore the many dental careers
            that keep our smiles healthy including dentists, dental hygienists,
            and dental assistants.

                Dr. Ayanna and her team believe that when girls see what’s
                possible, they start to dream bigger. Flossy Friends Academy was
                created to spark curiosity, build leadership, and encourage
                young girls, especially those from underrepresented communities,
                to consider a future in dentistry and oral health.

                During this free enrichment program, students will get a

                lessons and mentorship from real dental professionals. Each
                session is packed with discovery, skill-building, and fun.

                The earlier girls get exposure to healthcare careers, the more

                make that introduction memorable, empowering, and full of joy.

            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="bold">Hey tooth Friends! </span>I’m Dr. Ayanna
              Williams, a board-certified pediatric dentist, community educator,
              and the founder of Friendship Pediatric Dentistry.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ve dedicated my career to helping children from infancy through
              adolescence, including those with special healthcare needs, feel
              welcomed, safe, and supported in the dental chair.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe going to the dentist should feel like visiting a friend.
              Because when a child feels comfortable, confident, and cared for,
              everything about their oral health journey changes. I’m here to
              help every child build a bright smile and every parent feel
              empowered along the way.
            </p>
            <p class="quote">
              “Every child deserves a dental home where they feel safe, seen,
              and celebrated”
            </p>
            <p>
              As a Pediatric Attending Dentist with operating room privileges, I
              provide care in both private practice and hospital-based settings
              ensuring that every child has access to safe, high-quality
              treatment, no matter their needs or background.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also have the privilege of mentoring dental residents, helping
              them grow into compassionate, confident providers who are ready to
              care for kids with the same empathy and excellence I strive to
              deliver every day.
            </p>
            <p>
              With a heart for community health, I’m passionate about bringing
              dental education directly to families through health fairs and
              local outreach events. My Flossy Friends Academy program was built
              to open the door for girls to explore dentistry in a fun, hands-on
              way. I expand access to care, advocate for kids, and train the
              next generation to do the same.

              As part of her ongoing community involvement, she participates in

              their families.
            </p>
            <p>
              These outreach efforts are designed to make dental knowledge more
              accessible especially to families who may not regularly visit a
              dental office.

              the importance of brushing, flossing, and making healthy food
              choices, while also giving parents the tools they need to support
              their child’s oral health at home.
            </p>
            <p>
              Her goal is simple: to help families feel confident, informed, and
